# Welcome the Guide for a SteamOS–ish Windows 11

## DISCLAIMER

**Within this guide, you will find closed and open source tools that help tweak and debloat Windows. I won't be held responsible for bricking your Steamdeck ya-da-ya-da. In short, you run and install them at your own risk.**

** If you have no clue about anything you're doing, then you should consider doing research and get up to speed.

## This guide assumes you already have Windows 11 installed!**

**This is a guide that I hope will get you as close to the SteamOS experience as possible and also give you the best Windows experience possible.**

**I’ll be updating this as I discover stuff. So, might be worth the bookmark!**
